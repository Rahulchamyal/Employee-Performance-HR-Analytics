Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): These can be specific to each role or department, such as sales revenue, customer satisfaction scores, or project completion rates.
Attendance and Punctuality: Analyzing attendance records and punctuality can provide insights into employee reliability and commitment.
Employee Turnover Rate: Understanding the rate at which employees leave the organization can help identify potential issues and retention strategies.
Employee Satisfaction Surveys: Analyzing the results of employee satisfaction surveys can give insights into employee morale and job satisfaction.
Performance Appraisals: Reviewing performance appraisal data can help assess individual performance and identify areas for improvement.
Data Collection: Gather relevant data from various sources, including HR databases, performance evaluation records, time tracking systems, employee surveys, and other relevant sources.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to gain insights into the distribution of performance metrics, identify patterns, and visualize trends. This can involve creating histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and other visualizations.
3. Performance Segmentation: Group employees based on their performance levels and other relevant characteristics. This segmentation can help identify high-performing employees, average performers, and those who may need additional support.
4. Identifying Factors Affecting Performance: Use statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to identify factors that correlate with high performance. This may include factors like training, work experience, education level, department, or other relevant variables.

6. Employee Engagement Analysis: Analyze employee engagement data, such as survey responses and feedback, to understand the impact of engagement on performance.
7. Retention Analysis: Examine data related to employee turnover to identify patterns and factors that contribute to attrition. This can help develop retention strategies and improve employee satisfaction.
8. Recommendations and Actionable Insights: Based on the analysis, provide actionable insights and recommendations to the HR department and relevant stakeholders. These insights can support talent management decisions, training and development programs, and employee engagement initiatives.
